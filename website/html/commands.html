					<h3>Command Guide</h3>
					
				    <p>Say <kbd>help</kbd> to bring up a copy of this command guide.</p>

				    <p style="font-style: italic">Note: the most common problem is a command being misheard by the
				    speech engine. By observing the Hands Free input window, you can see
				    what it thinks you said. This may help you learn the proper
				    enunciations necessary in order to be understood more readily. </p>

				    <h3>Scrolling</h3>

				    <p>To scroll up a small amount, say <kbd>up</kbd>.<br>
				    To scroll down a small amount, say <kbd>down</kbd>.<br>
				    To scroll a small amount to the right, say <kbd>right</kbd>.<br>
				    To scroll a small amount to the left, say <kbd>left</kbd>.</p>

				    <p>To page up, say <kbd>rise</kbd>.<br>
				    To page down, say <kbd>fall</kbd>.</p>

				    <p>To scroll to the bottom of the page, say <kbd>bottom</kbd>.<br>
				    To scroll to the top of the page, say <kbd>top</kbd>.</p>

				    <p>To set the page scrolling continuously up, say <kbd>keep scrolling
				    up</kbd>.<br>
				    To set the page scrolling continuously down, say <kbd>keep scrolling
				    down</kbd>.<br>
				    To stop the page from continously scrolling, say <kbd>stop</kbd>.<br>
				    To control the speed of scrolling, say <kbd>faster</kbd> or
				    <kbd>slower</kbd>. The changes will be small, but you can issue these
				    commands repeatedly for incremental gains.</p>

				    <h3>Clicking</h3>

				    <p>To paint number tags alongside what are most likely visible,
				    clickable elements on the page, say <kbd>map</kbd>. The tags will
				    appear near the upper left corner of the corresponding link, image, or
				    input form. Even if the spacing occasionally comes out somewhat strange, a given number tag <i>will always be to the left of the element it corresponds to.</i></p>

				    <p>To click a numbered element, simply speak the number.</p>

				    <p>If you decide not to click anything, saying <kbd>map</kbd> a second 
				    time will hide the number tags, as will using any of the scrolling commands.</p>

				    <p>If the element you wish to click is not numbered by <kbd>map</kbd>,
				    try using <kbd>guide</kbd> instead. Saying <kbd>guide</kbd> while the <kbd>map</kbd> tags are active 
				    will hide the existing tags and draw new ones. The same is true in reverse.</p>

				    <p>The system by which clickable elements are numbered will be heavily improved in the future, but for
				    the time being there may be many frustrations in the placement of the numbers.</p>

				    <p>To alleviate this, there is a <kbd>show</kbd> command, which will sloppily paint numbers over nearly everything,
				    including elements you cannot see and therefore cannot click on. It's a last resort. But if <kbd>map</kbd> and <kbd>guide</kbd> don't paint a number next to the element you wish to click, the odds are very high that <kbd>show</kbd> will get the job done.</p>

				    <p>Again, saying <kbd>show</kbd> while <kbd>map</kbd> or <kbd>guide</kbd> are active will just hide the existing tags and draw new ones.</p>

				    <p><i>Note: There is currently no support for dropdown menus.</i></p>

				    <h3>Dictation Mode</h3>

				    <p>If you’ve clicked a text input, Hands Free will switch into
				    dictation mode, and anything you say will be written as text into the
				    selected text input.</p>

				    <p>To turn off dictation mode and return to the normal control
				    functionality, say <kbd>stop</kbd>.<br>
				    To submit the textbox you’re typing in (the equivalent of pressing
				    ‘enter’), say <kbd>go</kbd>. This is what you want when you finish
				    typing in a searchbox, for example.<br>
				    To move the cursor to the next input in the form (for example, from
				    username to password), say <kbd>next</kbd>.<br>
				    <br>
				    To remove the last word you entered from the textbox, say <kbd>undo</kbd>.</p>

				    <h3>Navigation</h3>

				    <p>To go to ANY website, say the name of the website on its own with
				    the domain specified. There is no need to say “www.”<br>
				    Examples: <kbd>google.com</kbd>, <kbd>en.wikipedia.org</kbd>
				    (pronounced E-N-dot-wikipedia-dot-org), <kbd>mit.edu</kbd> (pronounced
				    M-I-T-dot-E-D-U), <kbd>fr.wikipedia.org</kbd> (pronounced
				    F-R-dot-wikipedia-dot-org)</p>

				    <p>To go to a particular .com website, say <kbd>go to [website
				    name]</kbd>. You can include the .com or omit it.<br>
				    Examples: <kbd>go to google</kbd>, <kbd>go to google.com</kbd>, <kbd>go
				    to amazon</kbd>, <kbd>go to facebook</kbd></p>

				    <p style="font-style: italic">Note: there are some websites with longer
				    names which will register erroneously with the engine. For example,
				    there is no way to reach freecreditreport.com, which will be heard as
				    “free credit report.com”, and will consequently send you to
				    report.com.</p>

				    <p>To go back one page in your history, say <kbd>back</kbd>.<br>
				    To go forward one page in your history, say <kbd>forward</kbd>.</p>

				    <p>To go to google.com, say <kbd>home</kbd>. This will also automatically put the extension into 
				    dictation mode, and is the fastest way to search for things.</p>

				    <p style="font-style: italic">Note: Google can be used to indirectly reach almost any website that you can't
				    navigate to directly via Hands Free. For instance, going to Google and searching for
				    "free credit report.com" will correctly bring up as a result the actual "freecreditreport.com",
				    which you can then click on.</p>

				    <h3>Controlling Tabs</h3>

				    <p>To open a new tab, say <kbd>new tab</kbd>.</p>

				    <p style="font-style: italic">Note: When opening a new tab, only the "go to" command and tab control commands will work
				    unless you have installed the new tab redirect extension, which will cause new tabs to default to a page of
				    your choosing. That extension can be found on <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna?hl=en">the Chrome Web Store.</a></p>

				    <p>To close the current tab, say <kbd>close tab</kbd>.<br>
				    To switch the active tab to the next tab in the window, say
				    <kbd>switch</kbd>.</p>

				    <h3>Controlling the Window</h3>

				    <p>To enter or exit full screen mode, say <kbd>full screen</kbd>. All
				    commands work just the same in full screen mode.<br>
				    To minimize, say <kbd>minimize</kbd>.</p>

				    <p style="font-style: italic">Note: Unfortunately the ‘maximize’
				    command is broken in Chrome. You may be able to restore your window
				    from a minimized state by using the full screen command and then
				    toggling it off, but this has lately proved unreliable. Using the
				    minimize command is currently not recommended.</p>

				    <p>To close all Chrome windows entirely, say <kbd>exit</kbd> or
				    <kbd>quit</kbd>.</p>

				    <h3>Zooming</h3>

				    <p>To zoom in, say <kbd>zoom in</kbd><br>
				    To zoom out, say <kbd>zoom out</kbd>.<br>
				    To restore the zoom level to normal, say <kbd>zoom normal</kbd>.</p>

				    <h3>Refreshing</h3>

				    <p>To reload the page, say <kbd>reload</kbd> or <kbd>refresh</kbd>.</p>

				    <h3>Closing Hands Free</h3>

				    <p>Lastly, to turn off Hands Free, say <kbd>done</kbd>.</p>
